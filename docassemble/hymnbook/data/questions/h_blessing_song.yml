  We Bless You Lord for this gift of bread
  Fruit of the Earth work of human hands
  By Your Word, this gift is made
  The Bread of live given for man
  Blessed be our God for evermore

  We bless you Lord, for this gift of wine
  Fruit of the vine, work of human hands
  By Your word this gift is made
  Your life blood poured out for man
  Blessed be our God for evermore

  We bless you Lord for all gifts of life
  We work with them to make the world with you
  By your word all things converge
  All formed in Christ, all made anew
  Blessed be our God for evermore
