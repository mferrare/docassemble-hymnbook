  O Come All Ye Faithful  
  Joyful and triumphant,
  O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem.
  Come and behold Him,
  Born the King of Angels;
  O come, let us adore Him,
  O come, let us adore Him, 
  O come, let us adore Him,
  Christ the Lord.

  Sing, choirs of angels,
  Sing in exultation,
  Sing all ye citizens of heav’n above.
  Glory to God in the highest glory;
  O come, let us adore Him,
  O come, let us adore Him,
  O come, let us adore Him,
  Christ the Lord.

  Yea Lord, we greet Thee,
  Born this happy morning,
  Jesus to thee be al glory giv’n.
  Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing;
  O come, let us adore Him,
  O come, let us adore Him,
  O come, let us adore Him,
  Christ the Lord.

  Away in a manger, no crib for a bed
  The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head
  The stars in the bright sky looked down where He lay
  The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay

  The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes
  But little Lord Jesus, no crying He makes
  I love Thee, Lord Jesus! Look down from the sky
  And stay by my cradle till morning is nigh

  Be near me, Lord Jesus; I ask Thee to sta y
  Close by me forever, and love me I pray
  Bless all the dear children in Thy tender care
  And take us to Heaven to live with Thee there

  Said the night wind to the little lamb,
  Do you see what I see?
  Way up in the sky, little lamb.
  Do you see what I see?
  A star, a star, dancing in the night
  With a tail as big as a kite.
  With a tail as big as a kite.

  Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy,
  Do you hear what I hear?
  Ringing through the sky shepherd boy,
  Do you hear what I hear?
  A song, a song, high above the trees
  With a voice as big as the sea,
  With a voice as big as the sea.

  Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king,
  Do you know what I know?
  In your palace warm, mighty king
  Do you know what I know?
  A child, a child shivers in the cold
  Let us bring him silver and gold.
  Let us bring him silver and gold.

  Said the king to the people everywhere
  Listen to what I say!
  Pray for peace people everywhere
  Listen to what I say!
  A child, a child, sleeping in the night.
  He will bring us goodness and light
  He will bring us goodness and light

subject: "Mary's Boy Child"
content: |
  Long time ago in Bethlehem, so the holy Bible say,
  Mary’s boy child Jesus Christ was born on Christmas day.

  Hark now hear the angels sing a new king born today.
  And man will live for evermore because of Christmas day.

  While shepherds watched their flocks by night they see a bright new shining star.
  They hear a choir sing a song the music seemed to come from afar

  And then they found a little nook in a stable all forlorn
  And in a manger cold and dark Mary’s little boy was born

  Hark now hear the angels sing a new king born today.
  And man will live for evermore because of Christmas day.

  For a moment the world was aglow
  All the bells rang out.  There were tears of joy and laughter,
  People shouted “Let everyone know there is hope for all to find peace”

  Oh my Lord, You sent Your Son to save us
  Oh my Lord, Your very self You gave us
  Oh my Lord, that sin may not enslave us
  And love may reign once more
  *(repeat)*

  Hark now hear the angels sing a new king born today.
  And man will live for evermore because of Christmas day.

  Trumpets sound and angels sing, listen to what they say.
  That man will live for evermore because of Christmas day.

  *(Coda)*
  Because of Christmas Day!

  The angel Gabriel from heaven came
  His wings as drifted snow, his eyes aflame.
  “All hail”, said he, “thou lowly maiden Mary
  Most highly favoured lady”

  Gloria

  “For know a blessed mother thou shalt be
  All generations laud and honour thee.
  Thou son shall be Emmanuel by seers foretold,
  Most highly favoured lady”

  Gloria
  
  Then gentle Mary meekly bowed her head.
  “To me be as it pleaseth God”, she said.
  “My soul shall laud and magnify His holy name”
  Most highly favoured lady

  Gloria
