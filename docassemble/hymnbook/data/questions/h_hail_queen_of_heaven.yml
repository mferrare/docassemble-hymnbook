  Hail Queen of Heaven, the Ocean Star
  Guide of the wanderer here below
  Thrown on life's surge, we claimed thy care;
  Save us from peril and from woe.

  Mother of Christ, star of the sea,
  Pray for the wanderer, pray for me.

  O gentle chaste and spotless maid,
  We sinners make our prayers to thee;
  Remind thy Son that he has paid
  The price of our iniquity

  Virgin most pure, star of the sea,
  Pray for the sinner, pray for me.
