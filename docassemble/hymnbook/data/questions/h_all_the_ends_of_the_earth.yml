  **Chorus:**
  All the ends of the earth, all you creatures of the sea
  Lift up your eyes to the wonders of the Lord
  For the Lord of the earth, the master of the sea
  Has come with justice for the World

  1) Break into song at the deeds of the Lord
  The wonders God has done in every age

  2) Heaven and earth shall rejoice in Your might
  Every heart, every nation call You Lord

  3) The Lord has made salvation known
  Faithful to the promises of old
  Let the ends of the earth, let the sea and all it holds
  Make music before our King
