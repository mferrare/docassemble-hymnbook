  Glory to God in the highest
  And on earth peace to people of goodwill
  
  We praise you, we bless you, we adore you.
  We glorify you, we give you thanks for your great glory.
  Lord God heavenly king, O God almighty father
  
    Lord Jesus Christ only begotten son,
  Lord God, Lamb of God, son of the Father.
  You take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.
  You take away the sins of the world, receive our prayer.
  You are seated at the right hand of the father, have mercy on us.

  For you alone are the Holy One,
  You alone are the Lord.
  You alone are the most high Jesus Christ.
  With the Holy Spirit in the glory of God the Father.

  Amen. Amen. Amen!
