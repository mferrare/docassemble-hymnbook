  One bread, one body, one Lord of all,
  One cup of blessing which we bless.
  And we though many, throughout the earth,
  We are one body in this one Lord.

  Gentile or Jew
  Servant or free
  Woman or man no more

  Many the gifts
  Many the works
  One in the Lord of all

  Grand for the fields
  Scattered and sown
  Gathered to one for all
