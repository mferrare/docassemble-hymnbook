  Our Father who art in heaven,
  Hallowed be thy name.
  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
  On earth as it is in heaven.

  Give us this day our daily bread
  And forgive us our trespasses
  As we forgive those who trespass against us

  Ooooooooh

  And lead us not into temptation
  But deliver us, deliver us from evil.

  Ooooooooh
  
  (after 'Deliver us Lord from every evil...)
  
  For the kingdom, the power and the glory
  Are yours, now and forever
  Are yours, now and forever
  Amen
