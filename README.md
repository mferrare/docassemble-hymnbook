# Hymnbook

I created this for the Christmas Vigil Mass 2019 at St Mark's in Hectorville parish.
The idea was to print fewer hymn sheets and to allow people the option to access
the hymnbook on their phones.  As it is, I don't think it was used at all.

I set up this [bit.ly link](https://bit.ly/hecto2019).  I'll keep that.  Maybe
we can use it again...
